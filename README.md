## Outline:Using 10 years of data from Kaggle csv dataset, and api from Spotify, we will explore the common metrics behind US Music Top Ten Billboard hits.  Metrics measured are beats-per-minute(bpm), decibels(db), song duration(dur), and energy(nrgy).
          
## Question:  Can music artists and producers use these "behind the scene" metrics to help push their songs to the top of the charts. 

## Research:  Using the stated measured metrics, generate scatter plots, and bar graphs to show were these metrics standup within the top ten songs.  Use linear regression to show if there is a strong correlation between these metrics and top ten hits over a ten year period.  Try to integrate pythony cool graphics into the final presentation.
