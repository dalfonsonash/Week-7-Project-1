# Week 7 Group6: Project-1
# Title:  Behind the Music (Metrics for a Top Ten hit!)

## Team Members:
                Daisy Kolosovskiy
                Miguel Garcia
                Dave Alfonso
                
## Outline:Using 10 years of data from Kaggle csv dataset, and api from Spotify, we will explore the common metrics behind Spotifiy's top downloaded songs from 2010 to 2019.  Music metrics measured are beats-per-minute(bpm), decibels(db), song duration(dur), and energy(nrgy).
          
## Question:  Can music artists and producers use these "behind the scene" metrics to help help increase their download numbers on Spotify. 

## Research:  Using the stated measured metrics, generate scatter plots, and bar graphs to show were these metrics standup within the top songs.  Use linear regression to show if there is a strong correlation between these metrics and top ten hits over a ten year period.  Try to integrate pythony cool graphics into the final presentation.
