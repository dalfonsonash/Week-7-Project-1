# Week 7 Group6: Project-1
# Title:  Behind the Music (Metrics for a Top Ten hit!)

## Team Members:
                Daisy Kolosovskiy = (see Cleaned_Spotify.ipynb)
                Miguel Garcia = (see Artist_Spotify.ipynb)
                Dave Alfonso = (see Daves_Spotify.ipynb)
                
## Outline:Using 10 years of data from Kaggle csv dataset, created from a Spotify api by Micheal Morris (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhmores/spotify-top-100-songs-of-20152019), we will explore the common metrics behind Spotifiy's top downloaded songs from 2010 to 2019.  Music metrics measured are beats-per-minute(bpm), decibels(db), song duration(dur), and energy(nrgy).
          
## Question:  Can music artists and producers use these "behind the scene" metrics to help help increase their download numbers on Spotify. 

## Research:  Using the stated measured metrics, pie charts, and bar graphs to show how these metrics standup within the top genres and artists.  Try to find if there is a strong correlation between these metrics and top ten hits over a ten year period.  Try to integrate pythony cool graphics into the final presentation.
