# Title: Spotify Behind the Music (Metrics for a Top 100 hit!)

## Team Members:
                Daisy Kolosovskiy = (see Cleaned_Daisy_Spotify.ipynb)
                Miguel Garcia = (see Artist_Spotify.ipynb)
                Dave Alfonso = (see Daves_Spotify.ipynb)
                
## Outline:Using 10 years of data from Kaggle csv dataset, created from a Spotify api by Micheal Morris (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhmores/spotify-top-100-songs-of-20152019), we will explore the common metrics behind Spotifiy's top downloaded songs from 2010 to 2019.  Music metrics measured are beats-per-minute(bpm), decibels(db), song duration(dur), and energy(nrgy).
          
## Question:  Can music artists and producers use these "behind the scene" metrics to help help increase their download numbers on Spotify. 

## Research:  Using the stated measured metrics, pie charts, and bar graphs to show how these metrics standup within the top genres and artists.  Try to find if there is a strong correlation between these metrics and top ten hits over a ten year period.  Try to integrate pythony cool graphics into the final presentation.

## Conclusion: Based on analysis of music metrics we were unable to find any discernible difference that set the top genre apart from the rest
If you want to be in the top spot of Spotify downloads, be the next Katy Perry by having even metrics throughout your music to ensure longevity within the Top 100 spots.
